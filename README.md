# **ICritter (CSC 335)**

ICritter was a continuous project built over the course of a semester to showcase class objectives.

This project grew to contain various marine and land animals that had their personal interests mapped to a bitmap.  Interactions would determine if a cat that enjoys x,y,z could be friends with a penguin that likes x,a,b.  A GUI was designed so an owner could feed and track his ICritterâ€™s levels of happiness as he feeds them treats.

This project is broken down to 5 commits where each was a homework assignment for this course.  

Commit messages contain descriptions of the changes done.

I created in depth JUnit Test Cases for each stage of the project and they are visible in the respective test folder.
